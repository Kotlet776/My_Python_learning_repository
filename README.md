# My_pyton_learning_repository
This is my repository where a will add all my practice files, mini projects and projects. This repository will not be perfect, in fact this repository will have many bugs/mistakes because it sole purpose is to practice programing in python. If you see this repository and you see things that can be improved or changed for the better, lett me know.
